    <h1>Two weeks, 22% better results: Design approach comparison</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>We designed and developed a landing page for a health & wellness company’s new client-led acquisition channel. The page was tested head-to-head against one created by an external agency partner.</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>22% higher conversion</li>
        <li>7% greater engagement</li>
        <li>6% lower bounce rate</li>
        <li>Completed in 2 weeks compared to the agency's 3-month timeline</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Type of work: UX Design, Landing Page, Marketing</p>
    <p>Timeline: May 1 – 31, 2024</p>

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>A health and wellness company wanted to add direct client acquisition channels through marketing campaigns (ads + landing pages) that could both educate and convert prospects</p>
    <p>Our design (left) sticks close to the existing brand and focuses on user needs — “login, start journey, search for your coach” — over style & tone of voice.</p>
    
    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>We recognized an opportunity to provide additional value to the marketing team by creating an internal solution alongside the work provided by their contracted agency partner.</p>
    <p>This later turned into an even bigger opportunity for our team to redesign the whole marketing site.</p>

    <h2>Process: Speed Meets Strategy</h2>
    <p>We recognized an opportunity to provide additional value to the marketing team by creating an internal solution alongside the work provided by their contracted agency partner.</p>
    <p>This later turned into an even bigger opportunity for our team to redesign the whole marketing site.</p>

    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <p>We recognized an opportunity to provide additional value to the marketing team by creating an internal solution alongside the work provided by their contracted agency partner.</p>
    <p>This later turned into an even bigger opportunity for our team to redesign the whole marketing site.</p>

    <h3>Their Approach</h3>
    <p>3 months from first meeting to launch</p>
    <p>Proposed rebrand → Siloed workflow → Endless reviews → Launch</p>
    <p>Three-month comprehensive rebrand timeline</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Focus on voice, visuals, and aspirational messaging</li>
        <li>Limited access to internal program knowledge</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Extensive approval processes & revisions</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Siloed workflow between design & internal teams</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hand-off to development team with no previous relationship</p>

    <h2>Head-to-Head Results</h2>
    <p>Both pages ran from May 1 – May 31, 2024</p>
    <p>Our team’s page outperformed the agency in every main category from conversion to speed, proving that we can work faster and provide a more impactful experience.</p>
    <p>Simpler user flows & designs = happy visitors & more conversions</p>
    <p>We make sure the experience is defined by what people really need.</p>

    <h3>The Growth Impact</h3>
    <p>This 22% conversion improvement directly impacted the company's ability to scale beyond coach-dependent acquisition — exactly the kind of growth lever passionate founders need.</p>
    <p>While the external agency required a three-month timeline and significant budget allocation, our internal approach delivered superior results in two weeks — proving that small teams don't need massive resources to outperform traditional agencies.</p>

    <h3>What This Means for Growing Businesses</h3>
    <p>Small businesses need partners who can move at startup speed. While large agencies require extensive approval processes and revisions, we delivered results in the time it took them to complete initial concepts.</p>
