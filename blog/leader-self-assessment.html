    <h1>Leadership health: Self-assessment for business leaders and owners</h1>
    <p>Sometimes as leaders, we get lost in the noise of things that compete for our attention but donâ€™t matterâ€¦ This is not one of those things.</p>
    <p>This self-assessment can help any leader thatâ€™s wondering if they have their head in the right place. Itâ€™ll help you get back to the basics of what matters, and if youâ€™re like me feel a little like a slap in the face ðŸ˜‚</p>
    <h3>Core Business Health</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Can you explain what you do and who you serve in one clear sentence?</li>
            <li>Are you profitable, or do you know exactly when you will be?</li>
            <li>Do you have predictable revenue or a clear path to it?</li>
            <li>Are customers finding you without you having to chase them?</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Leadership & Operations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Do you spend most of your time working on the business or stuck in it?</li>
            <li>When you're away for a week, does everything fall apart?</li>
            <li>Can each person on your team clearly state their primary responsibility?</li>
            <li>Do you make decisions quickly, or do things stall waiting for perfect information?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Growth & Sustainability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Are you solving a real problem people will pay to fix?</li>
            <li>Do customers stick around and buy more, or do you constantly need new ones?</li>
            <li>Is your biggest constraint demand, capacity, or something else entirely?</li>
            <li>Are you building systems that work without you, or are you the bottleneck?</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Reality Check</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What would an outside investor say is your biggest weakness right now?</li>
            <li>If you had to focus on only three things for the next 90 days, what would they be?</li>
            <li>Are you growing because of your strategy or despite it?</li>
        </ul>
