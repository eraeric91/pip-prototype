    <h2>Our mission</h2>
    <p>To help home service companies to get found online and grow their business through SEO optimization and online advertising.</p>

    <h2>Our vision</h2>
    <p>We want people to exist peacefully in a world led by strong leaders that care for sustainable communities.</p>
    <p>We are the gardeners who create the healthy culture that groups and individuals need to break through their shells and grow.</p>

    <h2>Our values</h2>
    <p>1.  Take care of our people.</p>
    <p>2.  Lead from vision, execute in reality.</p>
    <p>3.  Decide, and move forward.</p>
    <p>We only decide after considering:</p>
    <p>1.  What would happen to our people if I didnâ€™t make this decision?</p>
    <p>2.  Will this decision hurt anybody?</p>

    <h2>Why "Pip"?</h2>
    <p>A pip is a small, hard seed in a fruit: A naturally occurring symbol of our own massive potential. If we can patiently care for each other we can break through our tough outer shells and grow into abundant trees that produce more fruit for others.</p>
    <p>We are building a safe, peaceful world for everyone. We stay realistic by first prioritizing the needs (not wants or nice to haves) of those we are responsible for.</p>
    <h3>Youâ€™re a pip, Iâ€™m a pip... Weâ€™re all a pip!</h3>
